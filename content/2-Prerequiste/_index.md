## ðŸš€ Implementation Contents

In this section, you will step-by-step build the environment to automate networking on AWS:

1. [Create IAM User and obtain Access Key, Secret Access Key, Public Key](2.1.1-createIAM/)  
   â†’ Create an IAM User and configure authentication information (access key, secret key).

2. [Create EC2 Instance and install AWS CLI](2.1.2-createEC2/)  
   â†’ Create an EC2 instance, select an appropriate instance type, configure (VPC, Subnet, Security Group), choose or create a key pair for SSH access, and launch the instance.
