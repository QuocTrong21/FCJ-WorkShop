In the context of modern system development and operation, especially for Java web applications running on the AWS platform, the requirements of **fast deployment, high security, scalability, and 24/7 availability** have become mandatory standards.

Manual infrastructure configuration involves many risks:
- Time-consuming
- Lack of consistency
- Difficult to manage configuration versions
- Hard to control rollback when issues occur

## ⚙️ What is Network Automation?

**Network Automation** is the use of tools and scripts to **automate the process of creating, configuring, monitoring, and managing network infrastructure**.  
With AWS, this includes:
- **Provisioning**: Automatically creating VPC, Subnet, Internet Gateway, Route Table, Security Group
- **Configuration**: Setting access permissions, ports, security rules
- **Monitoring**: Monitoring traffic, CPU, connections
- **Rollback**: Quickly restoring when deployment errors happen

---

## 🛠 Main Tools in the Project

1. **AWS CLI** – Running scripts to create and configure network via command line  
2. **AWS SDK for Java** – Integrating infrastructure management directly from Java applications  
3. **AWS CloudFormation** – Describing the entire infrastructure with YAML files (Infrastructure as Code – IaC)

## 🎯 Workshop Goals

This workshop will help you:
- Understand how to **fully automate AWS network infrastructure** for Java web applications
- Deploy faster, more accurately, and with fewer errors compared to manual operations
- Combine CLI, Java SDK, and CloudFormation for maximum efficiency
- Master **rollback processes**, testing, and configuration version management

---

### ✅ Provisioning & Configuration  
Automatically create and configure the network from scratch → system ready to run Java web applications

### ✅ Monitoring & Alerting  
Integrate CloudWatch Alarms and SNS for timely monitoring and alerts

### ✅ Rollback & Version Control  
Easily revert to stable states when deployment fails, manage configuration history with Git
