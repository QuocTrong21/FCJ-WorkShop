# Network Automation with AWS CLI, AWS SDK for Java, and CloudFormation

### Overview

This project focuses on **Network Automation** on AWS for Java web systems.  
The solution combines **AWS CLI**, **AWS SDK for Java**, and **AWS CloudFormation** to:

- **Provisioning**: Automatically create VPC, Subnet, Security Group, EC2 instances.  
- **Configuration**: Configure network resources via CLI and Java SDK.  
- **Monitoring**: Monitor the system using CloudWatch Alarms and send alerts via SNS.  
- **Rollback**: Restore infrastructure when deployment errors occur.  
- **Documentation**: Record processes and architecture.

This approach minimizes manual operations, ensures consistency, and speeds up infrastructure deployment for Java web projects (e.g., a movie streaming web app).
